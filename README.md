About
This project was coded as a 7-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository. I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course i took during my bachelor degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

Polymorphism and inheritance.
Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
Working with GUI.
