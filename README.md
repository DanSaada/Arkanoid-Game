<h1>About</h1>

This Arkanoid game was implemented as part of an OOP course i took during my bachelor degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

* Polymorphism and Inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Factory, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

<h1>Instructions </h1>
* Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle.
* Press 'p' to pause.
* Press 'Space' to re-enter the game.
* Pop all the blocks and progress through the game until victory or lose and try again :)
