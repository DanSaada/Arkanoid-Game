# Arkanoid-Game
An Arkanoid game as part of an Object Oriented Programing course i took at Bar Ilan university.

<h1>About</h1>

This Arkanoid game was implemented as part of an OOP course i took during my bachelor degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

* Polymorphism and Inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Factory, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

<h1>Design Patterns</h1>

<h2>Builder Design Pattern</h2>
The Builder design pattern played a pivotal role in this project, facilitating the creation of diverse game objects through a systematic, step-by-step approach. This approach not only enhances flexibility but also simplifies usability by assigning each builder class the task of constructing a particular object. Within our project, builders were harnessed to craft a variety of elements, including balls, blocks, and paddles, fostering a clear and structured development process.
Embracing this methodology translates into code that is not only more readable but also easier to maintain. Additionally, it streamlines the process of adjusting the properties of each object during its construction, ensuring adaptability and efficiency throughout the development cycle.

<h2>Decorator Design Pattern</h2>
The Decorator design pattern was used to add new functionalities to existing Animation objects. For example, the Background class serves as the base component class, and the BuildingBackground, RainCloudsBackground, SunBackground and TargetBackground classes are decorators that inherit from Background. These decorator classes add specific background drawing functionality to the base Background class by extending its drawOn method.
This pattern allows to compose different backgrounds with various features while keeping them interchangeable and encapsulated.

<h2>Observer Design Pattern</h2>
The Observer design pattern has been effectively utilized to manage events generated by diverse game objects. These game objects are structured as Observables, while the listener classes are structured as Observers. Listener classes subscribe to events emanating from game objects and respond accordingly, which may involve actions like eliminating blocks or balls from the game or updating the player's score. By employing the Observer pattern, the codebase maintains a high degree of flexibility and modularity. New listeners can be seamlessly integrated without necessitating alterations to the game objects themselves, resulting in a more maintainable and extensible system.

<h2>Factory Design Pattern</h2>
 In this pattern, the LevelInformation interface acts as a factory for creating different levels of the game, and concrete classes (LevelOne, LevelTwo, etc.) implement this interface to create specific level instances. This approach allows for the creation of various level objects without modifying the existing code, which aligns with the principles of the Factory design pattern.

<h1>Instructions </h1>

* Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle.
* Press 'p' to pause.
* Press 'Space' to re-enter the game.
* Pop all the blocks and progress through the game until victory or lose and try again :)

<h1>Installing And Executing</h1>
If you wish to try the game you can download the "Arkanoid.jar" from the release section.
